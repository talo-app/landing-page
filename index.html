          <h3>Origin Story</h3>
          <p>
            In April 2023, David Justice was learning the programming language Golang and was looking for project ideas to practice what he had learned. His wife Saveliga suggested building something that helped teach their kids Samoan as she was Samoan. The idea started as just an application for language learning, but quickly turned into something much more. After researching the market, David found a big issue. While their were multiple platforms for learning language, there wasn’t a platform solving the core problem that his family had. Disconnection.
            <br><br>
            They were living in New Jersey and they couldn’t find a single Polynesian person. It was important for their kids to grow up seeing people who looked like them. For them to know their language, eat traditional dishes, to be familiar with songs, traditions, and have other Samoan friends. Being in the northeast, it was frustrating for Saveliga having no family, friends, or people like her to connect with and being Black, David wanted to make sure his kids were exposed to both cultures, while also educating himself. 
            <br><br>
            This is the problem Talo is striving to solve. No matter where you live, you should never feel disconnected from your people. Talo is a platform that allows you to connect with people who share your culture, language, and traditions. It’s a place where you can learn about your culture, share your culture, and connect with people who share your culture.
